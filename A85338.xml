            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen he came firſt into the Caſtle there were 200, able men, 60. of them were liſted with Captaine <hi>Courtney</hi> to bee Warders, beſides 28. of the old War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and daily there came in more for ſafe-guard, and ſo in all there were 300. able men to beare Armes, and he verily beleeves there were men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children 300. more.</p>
            <p>He ſaith there was proviſion enough in the Caſtle brought in by the abler ſort at firſt, but the moſt part of them that were Warders had ſmall ſtore of proviſion, being moſt of them men that had bin ſtrip'd by the Iriſh, and poore Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that had little but from hand to mouth, and could not be ſuffered by the Towne to carry any thing into the Caſtle, but ſuch as could be gotten by favour and ſtealth.</p>
            <p>Hee ſaith there were in the Caſtle weapons for 200. men ſuch as they were, but not above ſixty Muskets and Calivers that were ſerviceable, the reſt were Petronells, Piſtolls, Carbines, browne Bills, and fowling peeces, three Demy-canons, two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars and one Minion.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:156853:2"/>
            <p>He ſaith that ever ſince Shrove-tide the Engliſh were ſtript, rob'd, and kild in the Towne, and all Letters were intercepted that came to the Engliſh by the Major, and many that came from the Lord Preſident to Captaine <hi>Courtney,</hi> and ſometimes the Caſtle people had liberty to goe to the Market and bring proviſion into the Caſtle, and anon they were hindred; all this while they were making a chaine thwart the River under the Caſtle, over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a place called Mock-begger, the chaine was made of long Aſpine Trees faſtned together with linkes of Iron, one end on Thomonſide faſtned to two Mil-ſtones, the other end to the Tower of the Key, the Caſtle perceiving that they intended to thwart the River, and ſo to hinder any releefe to come to the Caſtle by water, ſhot at them, ſo for a time hindred them, but afterwards it was ſet downe. He verily beleeves there was not above five or ſixe firkins of powder, and ſome of that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bad at that time, which was about five weekes ſince, then the Towne ſhot at the Caſtle, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently as many Engliſh as were in the Towne fled to the Caſtle for ſafe-guard of their lives, and brought no proviſion with them which did much peſter the Caſtle, and moſt of the reſt of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh that ſtayed in the Towne turned Papiſts, and ſo had ſome kind of protection. Then there was no quarter kept betweene the Towne and the Caſtle, but ſhot paſt betwixt them night and day, and ſome kild on both ſides: In the Caſtle were killed one <hi>Thomas Young, Iohn Slegg, Iohn Wethers,</hi> one <hi>Leonard,</hi> and a boy, ſeverall women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren hurt and kild, the ſhot played ſo continually
<pb facs="tcp:156853:3"/>from St. <hi>Maries</hi> Church, and other parts of the Towne, that none could ſtay in the Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and ſome few dayes after the Caſtle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Towne to begin a Mine neare Saint <hi>Nicholas</hi> Church-yard, which they were in about three weeks, and the Caſtle within Counter-mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and met the enemy, and the Caſtle men were beaten out by reaſon the enemies Mine was above the Caſtle Mine, ſo the enemy caſt downe water upon them, and ſo the enemy came under the Bulwark, and there ſet fire on the Timber that propt up the earth: within three dayes, part of the Bulwark fell downe.</p>
            <p>There was another Mine within two pierch of that, upon the ſtreet, going from New-gate to the Caſtle, which the enemy intended to bring under the Curtaine, next to the Bulwark, and with a counter-mine from the Caſtle was met, and the enemy forced out by the Warders and ſome of the enemyeskild, and ſo that Mine was deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>There was another Mine began next to the Towne Wall, which was intended to be brought to the South plat-forme, and went not farre with it, but the Water came in upon them, and then they took another way Eaſtward to come under the other Curtaine, and brought in neare the Curtaine, but it is not yet fallen, but the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy hath ſet fire to the underpropting, and certainly it will fall.

<pb facs="tcp:156853:3"/>Mine a little hole, being not deep from the top of the ground, fell in amongſt them, and beat them back to the Mine mouth, poſſeſt themſelves of two Iron Sakers, both of them being laden, the one they diſcharged, and the other they cloyd the Touch-hole with an Iron nayle, and ſo forced to leave their place, two of their ableſt men being ſhot, <hi>William Manwaring</hi> ſhot in the thigh, and afterwards dyed; <hi>Robert Helmes</hi> ſhot in the Thigh, and is yet alive: and ſo not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded with ayd they retreated, and came to the Caſtle, before the Bulwarke did crack, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any fire was put to the Timber, that did under-prop the wall. <hi>Garret Barey,</hi> and the Iriſh Generall, the Major ſent to Captaine <hi>Courtney</hi> perſwading him to yield the Caſtle, or elſe no Quarter. Anſwer was returned that the Caſtle was kept for the King, and would not bee yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Then the Generall ſent another Letter, adviſing them to yeeld, and they ſhould have Quarter, and goe away with their wearing appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell. Anſwer was returned to the Generall, that if they did ayme at the Armes in the Caſtle, and the goods that were there, they might get their lives if they could, for which they were reſolved to ſtand as long as breath laſted, whatſoever came of it; for the Armes they reſolued to take that courſe, that they ſhould not bee ſerviceable for them, and to deſtroy their goods by fire: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a parley was deſired, then Mr. <hi>Iones</hi> a Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of <hi>Limrick,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robert Lillies,</hi> were ſent up to them, and then in fine it was agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Generall Major and the Caſtle, and an
<pb facs="tcp:156853:4"/>oath taken for performing the conditions, the particulars whereof he knoweth not: part was, That all ſhould leave the Caſtle; and carry their goods with them that were their owne, but not other goods that were left there, and their perſons to be protected for foureteen dayes, and to bee ſafely conveighed to <hi>Cork,</hi> or <hi>Youghall:</hi> all this was concluded on Wedneſday the one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of <hi>June,</hi> 1642. But before the Caſtle was yeilded, one part of the Wall fell downe, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Wedneſday following, at eleven of the clock, the Iriſh Generall, the Major, the Lord of <hi>Muskrey,</hi> Baron of <hi>Loglemay,</hi> and all the Iriſh <hi>Captains</hi> and <hi>Commanders</hi> came to the Caſtle, the gate being open to them, and they had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to the Captaine: what paſt betwixt them he knowes not, but the Colours were poſſeſt by the Rebells: every one ſtriving by much adoe to to carry away their goods, which they did, and then the captaine went the ſame night, and lay there, and the next day went into the Town againe. Hee faith the enemy hath excellent powder, it gives but ſmall Report, but drives a Bullt with extraordinary force.</p>
            <p>The powder is made in Towne by Doctor <hi>Hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, Nich. Sower, Iohn Arthur, Fitz Iohn,</hi> and all St. <hi>Maries,</hi> and St. <hi>Iohns</hi> Churchare digged up three or foure foot deep, for ſalt Peter, and ſome ſay they make 100. pound a week, ſome ſay leſſe, the certainty of it he knoweth not.</p>
            <p>He ſaith that <hi>John Beech</hi> the Gunner, charging of the Cannon, and putting the powder, and ſome key ſhot, it fired at the mouth, killed the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb facs="tcp:156853:4"/>and three more, and <hi>William Bentley,</hi> and three more blaſted with the powder. Hee ſaith there was killed and dyed in the Caſtle firſt and laſt 220. men, women, and children, buryed in the Caſtle; moſt of them dyed of the Fluxe, and of-ſwelling under their feet: Divers came forth of the Caſtle very weak, and ſome dyed as ſoone as they were forth of the Caſtle. Hee ſaith, that when the Caſtle was yeilded up, there was but a Ferkin and an halfe of powder left.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop, Doctor <hi>Webb,</hi> being Biſhop of <hi>Limrick,</hi> being in the Caſtle, dyed the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was yeilded up.</p>
